## Detecting Phishing Websites on IBM Cloud
PhishFinder - Detecting Phishing Websites using Machine Learning on [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) (Auto AI Feature)

### Objectives

  1. To create a dataset and apply necessary preprocessing followed by feature selection.
  2. To apply various machine learning models and compare them based on different metrics.
  3. To run all the algorithms in the selected cloud platform using IBM Cloud's AutoAI feature to validate the choose obtained previously.
  4. To implement and deploy the selected machine learning model onto a cloud based platform.
  5. To predict the probability of a website being legitimate or phishing based on the URL of the website.
